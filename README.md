Course Code: 4741/5741

The UFC is among the worldâ€™s most popular mixed martial arts organizations. In a mixed martial arts fight, two fighters, one who fights out of the red corner and another who fights out of the blue corner, are allowed to punch, kick, elbow, wrestle, and grapple their opponents. Throughout this project, we will use feature engineering, exploratory data analysis methods like PCA, and prediction models like Logistic Regression in order to accurately predict the winning fighter. We will then use the probabilities of the model to determine how much to bet and see how profitable our model is on some held-out test data.
